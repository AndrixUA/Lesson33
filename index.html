			<h3>Netflix’s weighty new show follows thumpingly authoritative author Michael Pollan as he outlines the benefits of psychedelic drugs such as MDMA and mescaline. It’s hugely eloquent and convincing

			The last time I tried watching a show about psychedelic drugs, it didn’t end well. About a year ago, I watched something called Fantastic Fungi, which started off as a pleasant excuse for lots of time-lapse mushroom footage, but ended up as a fairly aggressive paean to the benefits of magic mushrooms. It was so effective that, by the time it finished, I was convinced enough to decide that I was definitely going to take up microdosing. But that didn’t work out because, like an idiot, I tried buying mushrooms online from the Netherlands. Long story short, I quickly received a letter from the UK Border Force saying – and I’m only slightly paraphrasing – “Hey dummy, we’ve got those drugs that you just tried to buy in the stupidest way imaginable, and we’re keeping them.” So I gave up.

		<p class="main">Based on his 2018 book How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence, the series offers a God’s eye view of the creation, prohibition and resurgence of four different psychedelic drugs: LSD, psilocybin, MDMA and mescaline. Taken alone the book was an absolute gamechanger, correcting some of the more virulent myths about psychedelics and opening the door to their potential ability to treat everything from depression to PTSD. Pollan’s book has already gained so much influence that this newspaper alone covers the new wave of psychedelics on a near monthly basis.

		<p class="end red">For the stragglers who haven’t caught up (I’m one of them), the series offers to send the book’s teachings into the stratosphere. Pollan is already an accomplished broadcaster – along with Samin Nosrat’s Salt Fat Acid Heat, his previous Netflix series, Cooked, helped to revitalise a food show genre that had long been threatening to wilt into an empty lifestyle echo chamber – but this is a much weightier affair.
